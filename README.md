# DAT200

This repository contains my solutions to compulsory assignments and other relevant materials from the Applied Machine Learning course at the Norwegian University of Life Sciences (NMBU).

All exercises are solved using python. The datasets are either provided directly in the assignments or retrieved through external API calls. Solutions are documented and presented in jupyter notebook *(.ipybn)* format.

The repository is intended for academic reference and documentation of coursework completed as part of the course.
